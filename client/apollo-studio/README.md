# Apollo Studio example

Simply open the GraphQL API URL (http://localhost:4000/graphql by default).

A landing page open and Apollo Studio suggest to explore the API at https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer

The solution offers an interesting "interactive documentation" which allows to explore the queries and fields of the API in a progressive way through GUI.
